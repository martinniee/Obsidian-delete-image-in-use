> Explanation of image attachment and reference link deletion:
>
> 1. If the image is only referenced **once** in the current note, it will be deleted directly along with its link.
> 2. If the image is referenced **multiple times** in the current note, a prompt window will appear asking the user to manually remove the link without deleting the image. (This is to prevent accidental deletion of the image.)
> 3. If the image is referenced by **multiple notes**, a prompt window will appear. The user can click the `close` button to continue removing the image reference link from the **current document**, without deleting the image. (This is to prevent accidental deletion of the image.)
>
> Explanation of automatic deletion of referenced attachments when deleting a note:
>
> 1. If the attachment is referenced by other notes, it will not be deleted.
> 2. If the attachment is only referenced once or multiple times in the **note to be deleted**, it will be deleted.
> 3. Deletion method: using the provided command of the plugin, or by right-clicking on the file list.
>
> Explanation of automatic deletion of attachment folder depending on the situation:
>
> - The parent directory of an attachment (usually an attachment folder) will be deleted only if the attachment is referenced once in the note to be deleted, and the attachment folder is empty after the attachment is deleted.
